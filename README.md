# Connect 4 AI Game

Welcome to the Connect 4 AI Game repository! This project implements a game of Connect 4 with a computer player that utilizes the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning for intelligent moves. The game comes with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to choose the algorithm and difficulty level.

## Game Overview

Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game where the goal is to be the first player to connect four discs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal. In this project, you can play against an AI opponent that is capable of making intelligent moves using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Features
